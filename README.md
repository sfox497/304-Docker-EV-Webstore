A fully functional EV Vechical webstore that includes the use of MySQL

Mission Statement:
The goal was to give customers the opportunity to easily filter, identify and purchase the EV that fits their every need. 

Executive Summary:
With the exponential growth of EV OEM options and new manufacturers, choosing which one is right for you can be daunting. Whether you are trying to find an EV to serve your fleet of commercial vehicles, or picking your replacement for a gas guzzling car, our database is designed to aid in your search by grouping and filtering EVs that are available on the market. The goal of our database is to make the transfer into the world of EV easier. We aim to bring forward all choices for EV in an accessible way and allow the customer to choose the vehicle “options” that they require. 
When visiting a dealership, there are many hurdles you may face trying to find out all the unbiased information about the vehicle and its competitors. Because we are independent, the information we provide is confirmed by the manufacturer and impartial.
When visiting our site, you can create an account to save your favourite choices and come back later to compare them. This allows you to adjust your filters, test drive the vehicles in person and then come back and make an educated decision.
